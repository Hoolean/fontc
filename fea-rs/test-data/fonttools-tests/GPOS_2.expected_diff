# generated automatically by fea-rs
# this file represents an acceptable difference between the output of
# fonttools and the output of fea-rs for a given input.
#
# In this case, fonttools does not sort these lookups, but we do.
# Ordering of lookups within a feature doesn't matter, and there issues
# no defined convention, so we have adopted the convention of always sorting
# them since it means our output will be stable regardless of whether some
# implementation change might cause lookups to be added in a different order.

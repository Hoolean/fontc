# Fontra samples

If construction of an example was non-trivial add notes here

* `component.fontra` built by taking a simple component glyph, 4E00, from notoserifcjkjp.fontra
   * Bonus points for exhibiting filename mangling
* `codepoints.fontra` built by:
   * Copying minimal.fontra
   * Hand-writing glyph-info.csv to have examples with 0, 1, 2, many codepoints
   * Copying .notdef's glyph file for each glyph name
